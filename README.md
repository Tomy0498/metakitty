=========

Metakitty -- The Metasploit Resource Portal. This is a staging area to
actually get this stuff up and running without accidentally stomping all
over metasploit-framework.

Note that this repo will disappear in a day, since the real project name
will be more boring once it's public. You will not be served well by
following it.
