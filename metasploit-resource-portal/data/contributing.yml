    Have something to share? Sweet. Metasploit wouldn't be where it is
    today without the hundreds of contributors who have pitched in over
    the years.

  comment:
    This is the purposefully short blurb that everyone who wants to file
    an issue against the Metasploit Framework repo should have already
    read. It even has a handy shortlink in the 'r-7.co' domain -- this
    makes it easy for regular contributors can gently remind
    would-be contributors to glance over it when submitting bugs and
    features.
